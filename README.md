#Notes (Katya Raman): 
- I used 2 late days on this lab even though I only had 1 left. I asked on Piazza about this and I was told that I could subtract a late day from a previous lab, and specify how I would like to allocate my late days here.
- I am extremely grateful for having this option. Here is how I would like to use my late days:  
    - Project 2 (1 late day): submission 63 => 3 late days left 
    -   - I used the second late day to submit my README for this project, so I would like to use this late day for project 6 instead. 
    - Project 5 (1 late day): submission 15 => 2 late days left
    - Project 6 (2 late day): I used my last two late days to complete this final project :D 

#Notes (Karanina Zim): 


Our implementation process:
1.) First, we implemented the assembly arithmetic operations. Our process for this was to pop the first value off the stack into reg eax, then pop the second value into ebx. 
  We then performed the arithmetic operation by using the appropriate x86 instruction. Given the order of the registers we used in our arithmetic instructions, 
  the result of the operation would be put into the eax register.
